<h2>I'm Abu Sayed (Abu Sayed - ICDCP_28)</h2>
<p>I have added everything as per instruction.</p>
<p>But as a <b>Git repo owner</b> I want to share what I was responsible for in our Git Repository Assignment.</p> 
<h3>1. Git Repository Creation:</h3> 
<p>My first task was to create the main Git repository for our group's project. I set up the repository on GitHub and provided a meaningful name and description for our project.</p> 
<h3>2. Adding Group Members:</h3> 
<p>After creating the main repository, I added our group members (Yasin Arafat Nowshad - ICDCP_24, Magferah Sultana Samia - ICDCP_14, Abidur Rahman Khan - ICDCP_59, F.M.Jahiduzzaman - ICDCP_86) as collaborators. This allowed them to contribute to our project and collaborate effectively.</p> 
<h3>3. Main Branch Protection:</h3> 
<p>I ensured that the main branch of our repository was protected. This meant that only pull requests would be allowed, preventing direct commits to the main branch. This protection helps maintain the stability of our project.</p> 
<h3>4. Open Issues:</h3> 
<p>As part of the assignment, I also created issues in the main repository. This practice familiarized us with issue tracking, which is crucial for project management and problem-solving.</p> 
<h3>5. Reviewing and Merging Pull Requests:</h3> 
<p>Once my fellow group members created their branches, made contributions, and submitted pull requests to the main repository, I took on the role of reviewing and merging those pull requests. This ensured that our contributions were integrated into the main project in an organized and controlled manner.</p> 
<h3>6. Overall Coordination:</h3> 
<p>I played a crucial role in coordinating our group's collaborative development efforts. Communication and coordination within our group were essential to successfully complete this assignment.</p> <p>In conclusion, I'm proud of our group's collective efforts in completing this Git Repository Assignment. We successfully created, managed, and contributed to Git repositories, ensuring that our project is well-organized and protected.</p> <p>Thank you for reading!</p>
